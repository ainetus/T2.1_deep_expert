# T2.1_deep_expert
Expert Agent python package exploiting the expert knowledge in two ways:
1. Focus the exploration phase of an RL agent (DeepQ) on specific zones of a power grid
2. Reduce the action space to most relevant ones and improve the scalability or RL agents. There are two variants of this approach:
    - *Heuristic-based*: A set of well known heuristics with some greedy search over the reduced action space is used to solve the overload and congestion problems;
    - *Learning-based*: A PPO tries to learn the effective topological manipulations on the grid, by considering the reduced action space. Its combination with some heuristics helps to remedy most of the overload and congestion problems.

# Credits
- Credits for Javaness [winning solution](https://github.com/lajavaness/l2rpn-2023-ljn-agent) at the L2RPN 2023 IDF AI challenge which has inspired the heuristic part of this work and most of the code is adapted and reused. The adapted code is on a forked repository which could be found [here](https://github.com/Mleyliabadi/l2rpn-2023-ljn-agent). 
- Credits for [CurriculumAgent](https://github.com/FraunhoferIEE/curriculumagent), which has inspired the search for reduced action space. Herein, we have replaced the greedy search over all the action space, by those suggested using expert knowlege. 
- The action suggested by expert knowledge uses the [ExpertOp4Grid](https://github.com/marota/ExpertOp4Grid) package.

# Expert Agent API
The RL based agent is also served over HTTP by a FastAPI application ([app/main.py](app/main.py)), which exposes a single endpoint returning a recommendation for a given grid event.

### Configure the token
The endpoint is protected by a bearer token read from the `API_TOKEN` environment variable. Copy the template and set your own value:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `.env` is git-ignored and must never be committed. Requests without a matching token are rejected with `401`, and the server answers `500` if `API_TOKEN` is left unset.

### Run with Docker Compose
Two configurations are provided, both building the image from the `Dockerfile` and reading the token from `.env`.

**Server deployment** — published on port `5000`, restarts automatically:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Local deployment** — published on port `5123`, can be installed alongside InteractiveAI:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build
```

Follow the logs (incoming payloads are logged to stdout) and stop the service with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```
Add `-f docker-compose.local.yml` to both commands to target the local deployment.

### Run without Docker
```bash
API_TOKEN=<your_token> uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Request a recommendation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/recommendation \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    --data @rte_recommendation.json
```
The request body carries an `event` object, a `context` object and an optional `cognitive_snapshot` object. Use port `5123` instead of `5000` for the local deployment, or `8000` when running `uvicorn` directly.

## How to use
A set of jupyter notebooks are provided to ease the use of the package for the users. Here is the list of notebooks:
1. [01_deep_q_expert.ipynb](getting_started/01_deep_q_expert.ipynb) : It shows how to use the extended DeepQ agent  
2. [02_expert_agent_heuistics.ipynb](getting_started/02_expert_agent_heuristic.ipynb) : It shows how to use the heuristic agent using the expert knowledge 
3. [03_expert_agent_RL.ipynb](getting_started/03_expert_agent_RL.ipynb) : It show how to use the RL based agent harnessing expert knowledge to reduce the action space.

## Reproducibility
### 1. DeepQExpert Agent
----
This agent applies an extended DeepQ algorithm for power grids and specifically works good with ``l2rpn_case14_sandbox`` environment.

#### Train
To train this agent, the following command could be executed from root and CLI:
```bash
python ExpertAgent/DeepQExpert/train.py \ 
    --save_path="l2rpn_case14_sandbox" \
    --num_train_steps=1000000 \
    --name="DeepQExpert" \
    --logs_dir="l2rpn_case14_sandbox/logs"
```
At the end of the training, the weights of the model and some information concerning the neural network architecture are saved and logged.

#### Evaluate
To evaluate an already trained version of it, the following command could be executed from root and using CLI:
```bash
python ExpertAgent/DeepQExpert/evaluate.py
```

At the end of the evaluation, a graphic representing the performance (reward/alive time) of the agent is visualized to the user.

### 2. ExpertAgent Heuristics
--------------------------
The heuristic version of the `ExpertAgent` does not require any training and the evaluation could be run using a main function included in the root of the package. This agent is already provided to work for `ai4realnet_small` scenario of AI4REALNET project and power grid usecase (first).

```bash
python main_expert_heuristic.py --nb_episode=15 --nb_process=1 --max_step=2016 --verbose=True 
```

At the end of the evaluation a graphic representing the performance (reward/alive time) of the agent is visualized to the user.

### 3. ExpertAgent RL
------------------
The RL based agent learning the reduced action space obtained using Expert Knowledge should be trained. The training could be launched using the corresponding `main` file provided in the `root` of the repository as:
```bash
python main_expert_rl_train.py
```

An already trained agent is also provided in the `root` of repository which can be loaded easily as (see [notebook](getting_started/03_expert_agent_RL.ipynb) for a full example):
```python
from ExpertAgent.utils import get_package_root
from ExpertAgent.ExpertAgent import ExpertAgentRL

env, env_gym = creat_env(...)

nn_kwargs = {...}

load_path = os.path.join(get_package_root(), "..", name, "model", "PPO_SB3")
agent = ExpertAgentRL(name="PPO_SB3",
                      env=env,
                      action_space=env.action_space,
                      gymenv=env_gym,
                      gym_act_space=env_gym.action_space,
                      gym_obs_space=env_gym.observation_space,
                      nn_kwargs=nn_kwargs
                      )

agent.load(load_path)
``` 

One the agent is trained or loaded, the evaluation could be done using the following command and the main file `main_expert_rl_eval.py`:
```bash
python main_expert_rl_eval.py --nb_episode=15 --nb_process=1 --max_step=2016 --verbose=True 
```
At the end of the evaluation a graphic representing the performance (reward/alive time) of the agent is visualized to the user.
